📱 Responsive Details

This activity uses CSS media queries — which allow styles to apply only if the user’s device meets certain conditions such as screen width — making designs adapt to mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

Example syntax:

@media screen and (max-width: 768px) {
  /* Styles for smaller screens */
